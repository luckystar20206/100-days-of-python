# module in python

In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions, statements, and functions. The file name is the module name
with the suffix `.py` added. For example, if you have a module named `mymodule.py`, you can import it in another Python
script using the `import` statement.

Here's an example of how you might use a module:

Suppose you have a file named `mymodule.py` with the following content:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

You can then use this module in another Python file like this:

```python
import mymodule

mymodule.greet("Alice")
result = mymodule.add(2, 3)

print(result)
```

In this example, `mymodule` is imported using the `import` statement. Then, we can use the functions `greet` and `add`
from `mymodule` by using the dot notation (`mymodule.greet(...)` and `mymodule.add(...)`).

Modules allow you to organize your code into separate files, making it easier to manage and reuse. They are a
fundamental concept in Python programming and play a crucial role in building larger and more complex applications.

# random module

The `random` module in Python provides functions to generate random numbers. Here are some of the commonly used
functions from the `random` module:

1. **`random()`**: This function returns a random float in the range [0.0, 1.0).

   ```python
   import random

   rand_num = random.random()
   print(rand_num)
   ```

2. **`randint(a, b)`**: This function returns a random integer in the range [a, b], including both endpoints.

   ```python
   import random

   rand_int = random.randint(1, 10)
   print(rand_int)
   ```

3. **`choice(seq)`**: This function returns a random element from a non-empty sequence.

   ```python
   import random

   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   rand_element = random.choice(my_list)
   print(rand_element)
   ```

4. **`shuffle(seq)`**: This function shuffles the elements in a list in-place.

   ```python
   import random

   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   random.shuffle(my_list)
   print(my_list)
   ```

5. **`sample(population, k)`**: This function returns a new list containing k unique elements chosen from the population
   sequence.

   ```python
   import random

   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   rand_sample = random.sample(my_list, 3)
   print(rand_sample)
   ```

6. **`uniform(a, b)`**: This function returns a random float number in the range [a, b).

   ```python
   import random

   rand_float = random.uniform(2.5, 5.0)
   print(rand_float)
   ```

Remember to import the `random` module before using these functions. Keep in mind that random numbers generated by
computers are not truly random, but are generated through algorithms. Therefore, they are referred to as "
pseudo-random". If you need true randomness, you would typically use external hardware or services.

# split method in string

The `split()` method in Python is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. This
delimiter can be a character, a space, or even a sequence of characters.

Here's an example:

```python
sentence = "Hello, how are you today?"
words = sentence.split()  # By default, split() uses spaces as the delimiter
print(words)
```

Output:

```
['Hello,', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'today?']
```

In this example, the `split()` method is applied to the `sentence` string. Since no specific delimiter is provided, it
uses spaces by default. As a result, the sentence is split into a list of words.

You can also specify a custom delimiter by passing it as an argument to the `split()` method. For instance:

```python
sentence = "apple,banana,cherry,date,fig"
fruits = sentence.split(",")  # only comma used as delimiter
print(fruits)
```

Output:

```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'fig']
```

In this example, the `split(",")` method is used, which means the string will be split at every comma.

Keep in mind that `split()` returns a list of substrings, so you can assign the result to a variable and work with it as
you would with any other list in Python.

# modify split method by comma

1. If you want to take input using the `split()` method in Python, you can use the `input()` function to get a string
   from
   the user, and then apply `split()` to that string.

   Here's an example:

   ```python
   # Taking input from the user
   user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ")
   
   # Splitting the input into a list of numbers
   numbers = user_input.split()
   
   # Converting the strings to integers
   numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
   
   # Printing the list of numbers
   print("List of numbers:", numbers)
   ```

   In this example, the program prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. The user's input is
   then
   stored in the variable `user_input`. Next, the `split()` method is applied to `user_input` to separate the numbers
   based
   on spaces, resulting in a list of strings. Finally, the list comprehension `[int(num) for num in numbers]` converts
   these strings to integers.

   For example, if the user enters `"1 2 3 4 5"`, the program will output:

   ```
   List of numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

   Keep in mind that `split()` separates the input based on spaces by default. If you want to use a different delimiter,
   you can pass it as an argument to the `split()` method. For example, if the numbers are separated by commas, you can
   use `split(",")`.

2. If you want to take input with commas and split it into a list of elements, you can modify the code accordingly.
   Here's
   an example:

   ```python
   # Taking input from the user
   user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by commas: ")
   
   # Splitting the input into a list of numbers
   numbers = user_input.split(',')
   
   # Converting the strings to integers
   numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
   
   # Printing the list of numbers
   print("List of numbers:", numbers)
   ```

   In this modified version, the program prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by commas.
   The `split(',')`
   method is used to separate the numbers based on commas, resulting in a list of strings. The list
   comprehension `[int(num) for num in numbers]` converts these strings to integers.

   For example, if the user enters `"1, 2, 3, 4, 5"`, the program will output:

   ```
   List of numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

3. If you want to use a comma followed by a space `(", ")` as the delimiter to split the input, you can modify the code
   accordingly. Here's an example:

   ```python
   # Taking input from the user
   user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by commas and spaces: ")
   
   # Splitting the input into a list of numbers
   numbers = user_input.split(', ')
   
   # Converting the strings to integers
   numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
   
   # Printing the list of numbers
   print("List of numbers:", numbers)
   ```

   In this modified version, the program prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by commas and spaces.
   The `split(', ')` method is used to separate the numbers based on the comma followed by a space, resulting in a list
   of
   strings. The list comprehension `[int(num) for num in numbers]` converts these strings to integers.

   For example, if the user enters `"1, 2, 3, 4, 5"`, the program will output:

   ```
   List of numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

# Can we use split for integers?

The `split` method is a string method in Python, and it is not applicable to integers.

If you want to "split" an integer into its individual digits, you would need to convert it to a string first, then apply
the `split` method or use other methods like using a loop to extract each digit.

For example, if you have the integer `12345`, you can convert it to a string and then split it like this:

```python
num = 12345
num_str = str(num)
digits = num_str.split()
```

This would give you a list of strings `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`. If you want the individual digits as integers, you
would need to convert them back:

```python
digits = [int(digit) for digit in num_str]
```

Now `digits` will be a list of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

# lists

In Python, lists are a type of data structure that allows you to store a collection of items. These items can be of any
data type (e.g., integers, strings, etc.) and can even be other lists. Lists are ordered, which means you can access
their elements by their position (index) in the list.

Here are some basic operations you can perform with lists in Python:

### Creating a List:

You can create a list by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements within square brackets `[ ]`.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Accessing Elements:

You can access elements in a list using their index. The index starts at 0 for the first element.

```python
first_element = my_list[0]  # Accesses the first element (1)
second_element = my_list[1]  # Accesses the second element (2)
```

### Slicing:

You can also extract a portion of the list using slicing. This is done by specifying a start and end index separated by
a colon `:`.

```python
sublist = my_list[1:3]  # Returns a sublist containing elements at index 1 and 2 ([2, 3])
```

### Modifying Elements:

You can change the value of an element by assigning a new value to it using its index.

```python
my_list[2] = 10  # Changes the third element to 10
```

### Adding Elements:

You can add elements to the end of a list using the `append()` method.

```python
my_list.append(6)  # Appends 6 to the end of the list
```

### Removing Elements:

You can remove elements from a list using the `remove()` method or the `pop()` method.

```python
my_list.remove(4)  # Removes the first occurrence of 4
popped_element = my_list.pop(2)  # Removes and returns the element at index 2
```

### Finding the Length:

You can find the length of a list using the `len()` function.

```python
length = len(my_list)  # Returns the number of elements in the list
```

### Checking if an Element is in a List:

You can use the `in` keyword to check if an element is present in a list.

```python
if 3 in my_list:
    print("3 is in the list")
```

### Concatenating Lists:

You can concatenate two lists using the `+` operator.

```python
new_list = my_list + [7, 8, 9]
```

### Iterating Through a List:

You can use a loop, like a `for` loop, to go through each element in a list.

```python
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

These are some of the basic operations you can perform with lists in Python. They are very versatile and widely used in
various programming tasks.

# list methods

Certainly! In Python, lists have several built-in methods that allow you to perform various operations on them. Here are
some common list methods:

### 1. `append(element)`

Appends a single element to the end of the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### 2. `extend(iterable)`

Appends the elements of an iterable (e.g., another list) to the end of the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
another_list = [4, 5, 6]
my_list.extend(another_list)  # my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### 3. `insert(index, element)`

Inserts an element at the specified index.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.insert(1, 10)  # my_list is now [1, 10, 2, 3]
```

### 4. `remove(element)`

Removes the first occurrence of the specified element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
my_list.remove(2)  # my_list is now [1, 3, 2, 4]
```

### 5. `pop([index])`

Removes and returns the element at the specified index. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last
element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
popped_element = my_list.pop(1)  # my_list is now [1, 3, 4], popped_element is 2
```

### 6. `clear()`

Removes all elements from the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.clear()  # my_list is now []
```

### 7. `index(element[, start[, end]])`

Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
index = my_list.index(2)  # index is 1
```

### 8. `count(element)`

Returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
count = my_list.count(2)  # count is 2
```

### 9. `sort([key[, reverse]])`

Sorts the list in ascending order. You can provide a `key` function to customize the sorting.

```python
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
my_list.sort()  # my_list is now [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
```

### 10. `reverse()`

Reverses the elements of the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list.reverse()  # my_list is now [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### 11. `copy()`

Returns a shallow copy of the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
copy_list = my_list.copy()
```

### 12. `remove(element)`

Removes the first occurrence of the specified element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
my_list.remove(2)  # my_list is now [1, 3, 2, 4]
```

### 13. `count(element)`

Returns the number of occurrences of the specified element.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
count = my_list.count(2)  # count is 2
```

These are some of the commonly used list methods in Python. They provide a wide range of functionality for working with
lists effectively.

# positive and negative indexing in lists

In Python, you can access elements in a list using both positive and negative indexing.

### Positive Indexing:

Positive indexing starts from 0 for the first element, 1 for the second, and so on. It allows you to access elements
from the beginning of the list.

For example, consider the list `my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`:

- `my_list[0]` returns `10`
- `my_list[1]` returns `20`
- `my_list[2]` returns `30`
- and so on.

### Negative Indexing:

Negative indexing starts from -1 for the last element, -2 for the second-to-last element, and so on. It allows you to
access elements from the end of the list.

For example, using the same list `my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`:

- `my_list[-1]` returns `50`
- `my_list[-2]` returns `40`
- `my_list[-3]` returns `30`
- and so on.

Negative indexing can be especially useful when you want to access elements near the end of a list and you don't know
the exact length of the list.

Here's a quick example:

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(my_list[-1])  # Outputs: 50
print(my_list[-2])  # Outputs: 40
```

Remember, whether using positive or negative indexing, it's important to ensure that the index you use is within the
bounds of the list to avoid an "index out of range" error.

---

# Nested list

A nested list in Python is a list that contains other lists as elements. This allows you to create a hierarchical
structure of data. Each inner list can have its own elements, including other lists.

Here's an example of a nested list:

```python
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

In this example, `nested_list` contains three inner lists, each of which represents a row of numbers.

You can access elements in a nested list using multiple indices. For example, to access the element `5`, you would
use `nested_list[1][1]` because it's in the second inner list (`nested_list[1]`) and at the second position within that
list (`nested_list[1][1]`).

You can also use loops to iterate through the elements of a nested list:

```python
for inner_list in nested_list:
    for element in inner_list:
        print(element)
```

This code will print:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

In this loop, we first iterate through the inner lists, and then for each inner list, we iterate through its elements.

You can also create more complex nested structures with lists inside lists inside lists, and so on. This allows you to
represent various types of data in a structured and organized manner.

# Slicing in python

Certainly! In Python, slicing is a way to extract a portion of a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) using a
specific syntax. The basic syntax for slicing is:

```python
sequence[start:stop:step]
```

- `start`: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).
- `stop`: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).
- `step`: The step size for the slice. It determines how many elements to skip.

Here are some examples to illustrate slicing:

### Example 1: Slicing a List

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Extract elements from index 2 to 5 (exclusive)
sliced_list = my_list[2:5]  # Result: [3, 4, 5]

# Extract every second element from index 1 to 7 (exclusive)
sliced_list = my_list[1:7:2]  # Result: [2, 4, 6]
```

### Example 2: Slicing a String

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Extract characters from index 1 to 5 (exclusive)
sliced_string = my_string[1:5]  # Result: 'ello'

# Reverse the string using slicing
reversed_string = my_string[::-1]  # Result: '!dlroW ,olleH'
```

### Example 3: Slicing a Tuple

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

# Extract elements from index 2 to 7 (exclusive)
sliced_tuple = my_tuple[2:7]  # Result: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
```

Keep in mind that when slicing, if you omit `start`, it will default to the beginning of the sequence. If you
omit `stop`, it will default to the end of the sequence. If you omit `step`, it will default to 1.

Remember, indices in Python are 0-based, which means the first element has an index of 0.
